Final Project Research Plan

For my final project, I plan on making an Amazon Echo using a Raspberry
Pi and a few other parts. To do this, I will be using the Amazon Alexa
Skills Kit.

Some of the intermediate steps I will have to take are as follows.
First, I will need to install an operating system onto the Pi device (I
will be using Raspbian). The second step will be to register an Amazon
Developer Account (I already have one), and then register my Pi device
using the Raspberry Pi’s IP address. Next, I will install Git and
AlexaPi on the device, and then run the installation script. I will then
setup all the necessary settings and details to finish the process and
will use the registered device profile from earlier to connect to my Pi
device.

Some of the risks and challenges are as follows. I might not be able to
find the right parts to put together the Amazon Echo, which will
prohibit me from continuing. There may be problems with the installation
process, which will either require me to try another way or not continue
the project.

Below is a list of the items / parts that I will need for the project.

-   A Rapsberry Pi with Raspbian installed.

-   A power cable

-   A microSD card

-   A USB microphone

-   Speakers for audio playback

-   At least a keyboard for command input

There aren’t too many needed items, and the overall cost of the project
should not cost too much. I look forward to trying this project out and
making more in the future!
